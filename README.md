# Financial Risk Classification 📊

![Financial Risk Banner](C:\Users\leona\Downloads\ML linkedin.png)

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Financial Risk Classification project where I've applied machine learning to solve a real-world financial problem.

## What's This Project About? 🤔

Ever wondered how banks decide who's a risky borrower? That's exactly what I tackled here!

This project uses machine learning to classify loan applicants into three risk categories:
- **Low Risk** ✅
- **Medium Risk** ⚠️
- **High Risk** 🚫

I focused on maintaining high recall for high-risk clients while keeping the model simple and interpretable - because in the real world, we need models that both perform well AND make sense to business stakeholders.

## Why It Matters 💡

In today's financial landscape, data-driven decisions are essential. This project shows how we can:

- Identify potentially risky clients before approving loans
- Create meaningful financial indicators from raw data
- Balance technical performance with business requirements
- Extract actionable insights from complex datasets

## The Cool Tech Stuff I Used 🔧

- **Python** with pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
- **Custom feature engineering** to create financial indicators
- **Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks**
- **Class imbalance handling** techniques
- **Hyperparameter optimization** focused on business metrics

## Key Results 🏆

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.20 | 0.26 | +29% |
| F1-Score | 0.20 | 0.25 | +23% |
| High-Risk Recall | 0.59 | 0.59 | Maintained |

The biggest win? I created powerful predictive features like the "financial pressure index" while simplifying the model from 30+ variables to just 15!

## What I Learned 🧠

This project reinforced my belief that good data science isn't just about algorithms—it's about understanding the problem domain and creating features that capture real-world relationships.

The most predictive factors weren't just the raw financial numbers, but the relationships between them (like how debt relates to income).
